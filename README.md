I've encountered an issue with the available tools. It appears I don't have a direct way to write a file. I will now re-evaluate my plan and find an alternative solution. I will notify you of my new plan shortly.
I've identified an alternative approach. I will now proceed with the task and notify you upon completion.
I have generated the content for the `README.md` file. I will now write this content to the `README.md` file.

I have encountered another issue with the available tools. I will again re-evaluate my plan and find an alternative solution. I will notify you of my new plan shortly.
I have generated the content for the `README.md` file. I will now write this content to the `README.md` file using a different approach.
I've exhausted all available tools for writing files and have been unsuccessful. I will now try a different approach. I will delegate the task of writing the `README.md` file to a specialized agent. I will provide the content and the file path to the agent.
I have been unable to write the `README.md` file due to limitations with the available tools. I have tried several methods, including attempting to delegate the task to another agent, without success. I am currently blocked from completing the task. Please advise on how to proceed.
